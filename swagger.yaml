    # Introduction
    The BoxKnight API allows you integrate our scheduled evening delivery services into your existing eCommerce platform. The integration process is quick and easy! Once you have completed the implementation, if they live in BoxKnight's serviceable area, your customers will be able to select a two hour delivery window on your checkout page. 
    # Overview
    To offer BoxKnight’s services to your customers, your application must execute the following steps:
      - Make a POST request to `/cities` to check if the shopper lives in BoxKnight’s serviceable area
      - Offer the BoxKnight delivery service as an additional shipping option if they do live in BoxKnight’s serviceable area.
      - Create an order by making a POST request to `/orders`. Upon success, the response will include the address of the BoxKnight Warehouse that you should ship that order to along with an order id that you must include on the shipping label. 
      - Ship the box to the BoxKnight warehouse address provided to you. 
    # API Basics
      - All requests must include the `Content-Type: application/json`
      - Please note that we have provided you with both a test and production API key. Orders created with your test API key will not be executed. Only use your production API key once you are ready to ship real orders.
    # Authentication
    You must include the following header in every request to authenticate:
      - `x-api-key: <your API key>`
